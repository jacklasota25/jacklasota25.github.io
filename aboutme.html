			<h3>My name is Jack Lasota. I am a third year architecture student at ASU. On this site, you will find work that is entirely made by me. I have been interested in architecture, design, and all things related for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I found Legos very exciting and interesting, and I even had many different Lego architecture sets; they were always my favorite. As I got older, I became more interested in drawing, as well as computers. All of these things pointed toward the fact that architecture was the right major for me. It was the best of all worlds, using digital programs and pen and paper to make drawings, as well as letting my creativity run free.</h3>
			<h3>So far, I have enjoyed my time at ASU. I like being able to come up with ideas and watch them come to life, literally in the shape of models and 3D prints. I really like creating digital drawings of my projects though, which is what can be found on this site. I use Rhino 7 to create digital models, and then from there I can export lineworks to then edit with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. While Photoshop is more known and has more features overall, I've found working in Illustrator best for my interests, so that is what I use most often for the drawings in my portfolio.</h3>
