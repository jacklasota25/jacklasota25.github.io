			<h3>This drawing depicts the floorplan for a proposed library that myself and a colleague worked on. The library itself utilizes fractal design to stimulate calmness and relaxation in the mind. The library has an increased focus on mental well being, so capitalizing on it in every possible area is good. This drawing was made with Adobe Illustrator.</h3>
			<h2><div id="sitesection"></div></h2>
			<h3>This drawing is a site section of the same library shown in the drawing above. A site section is a drawing that cuts through the land itself, showing the insides of the terrain and sometimes even the buildings themselves. This drawing gives a good perspective of what a user of the space might see, giving the viewer a sense of the scale and perspective.</h3>
			<h2><div id="littlelibrary"></div></h2>
			<h3>This drawing depicts a smaller library, one that would be found in a neighborhood for kids to come and pick up annd return books as they please. The little library itself is inspired by Harry Potter, utilizing elements of design from Hogwarts Castle. This library is much more finished and thought out compared to the larger one, so that si why more elemnents of creation are shown, like scale, perspectives, and a diagram of how it works and moves.</h3>
